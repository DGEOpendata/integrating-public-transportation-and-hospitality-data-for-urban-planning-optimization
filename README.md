## Integrating Public Transportation and Hospitality Data for Urban Planning Optimization

### Overview
This project aims to integrate public transportation usage data with hospitality performance metrics to optimize urban planning and service delivery in Abu Dhabi. By analyzing the correlations between transit ridership and hotel occupancy trends, city planners can make data-driven decisions to enhance urban mobility and tourism experiences.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Datasets:
  - `Abu_Dhabi_Public_Transportation_Usage_Statistics.csv`
  - `Abu_Dhabi_Hotels_Open_Datasets1.xlsx`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/urban-planning-optimization.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd urban-planning-optimization
   
3. Install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   

### Usage
1. Load the datasets into the project directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
   bash
   python analyze_data.py
   
3. View the correlation results and graphs generated in the output.

### Analysis
The script merges public transportation and hotel datasets on a common key (e.g., date) and analyzes the correlation between peak ridership and hotel occupancy rates. It generates a plot to visualize trends and prints out the correlation coefficient.
